# Embeddings Projector [![Build](https://github.com/jlopez/embeddings-projector/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jlopez/embeddings-projector/actions/workflows/build.yml)

### Embedding Projector

The Embedding Projector allows you to visualize high-dimensional data; for
example, you may view your input data after it has been embedded in a high-
dimensional space by your model. The embedding projector reads data from your
model checkpoint file, and may be configured with additional metadata, like
a vocabulary file or sprite images. For more details, see [the embedding
projector tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings).
